# implementing image processing functions
In this mini-project, I implement the basic functions and algorithms used in digital image processing without using Matlab built-in functions, so that we get familiar with them and perfectly understand their functioning. 
methods and algorithms included in this mini project are:

 - image channels display
 - image histogram
 - cropping image
 - filtering RGB images (*max filter, min filter, median filter, average filter and Gaussian filter*)
 - edge detection algorithms (*Sobel, Prewitt, Laplacian and Laplacian of Gaussian*) 
 - segmentation of RGB image using K-means clusturing algorithm.
