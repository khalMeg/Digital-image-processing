# Graphical Representation
Here we will see how to: 

 1. split channels of an RGB image, and display them.
 2. crop an image from any region by choosing only the top left corner and the down right corner of the cropped image.
 3. display the histogram of the image after converts it to a gray scale image. (note that if you want to display the histogram of the RGB image you have to find the histograms of its channels, after that you can display them separately or you concatenate them in one histogram)
